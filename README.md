# React Shopping Cart Project

This is the shopping cart project as part of The Odin Project's React course within the full-stack javascript pathway. The primary objective is to combine all the basic concepts from previous assignments (managing state, styling React components, styling in React, etc.) and create a mock online storepage single page application.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
